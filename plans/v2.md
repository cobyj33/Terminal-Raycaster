# Goals for version V2

To be honest, this project is in its finished state in a technical sense. I don't plan to try to support different shapes, textures, lighting, or anything of that sense, but I feel like there could be a lot more accessibility in the project for any user.

This document is more of a spec for what will be added and how it should be implemented rather than to be read by any user of *Terminal Raycaster*, but anyone is free to read to understand the planned direction of the project.

Here are the plans for the features that I feel like are necessary for the project, as well as my initial ideas as to how they will be implemented for the next "release"

## Moving the map data from a text file to a JSON file, as to promote the extensibility and readability of the map data

**MAIN PRIORITY**: An easy way to edit, load, and save map files for the user
The setup for the first iteration of the JSON data will simply look like such:

```json
{
    "format": "v1.0",
    "map": [0 or 1, ...]
    "width": int,
    "height": int,
    "spawn": {
        "row": int,
        "col": int
    }
}
```

- Notes:
  - The format **must** be "v1.0"
  - In the "map" field, the length of the array must be the length of the width * height. 
  - **The minimum height for a map will be 3 and the minimum width will be 3 as well**
  - Loading an incorrect file should not only be stopped and terminated, but should also output a reason for the termination, some of these reasons should be but are not limited to:
    - Incorrect JSON Syntax
    - Missing required key
    - Inclusion of values that are not 0's or 1's
    - Dimensions under the minimum dimension for the map **(3x3)**
    - A completely filled map ( all 1's ), as there will be no area to spawn
    - A completely empty map ( all 0's ), as there will be an infinite void world
    - A key that has an incorrect data type
    - A key that has an incorrect value
  - Warnings should be issued on the basis of
    - A spawn point inside of a wall, although a nearby spawn point could be found through searching around the area of the spawn point
    - JSON Keys that have no meaningful definition

The loader for all files should inherit a generic interface with ```string Save()``` and ``` Map Load(JSON map)``` functions, as there may be different formats that can be used and will need their own loader implementation
  
## A more cross-platform way to display into the terminal

- As of now, I am working with the [Terminal.GUI](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui) library, as it supports not only cross-platform terminal output but also menu bars and other widgets that would allow more expansive and interactive editors and viewers
  
## An easy way to load a map from a command, using a format like ```dotnet run <file>```

Each file will of course be tested and validated by its format, and will return an error if it cannot match against any file formats
If it does not match its format, the parser for that particular format will also throw an error

## Map presets to load, such as "maze" or "alleys" of some sort, which use an algorithm or can take their own arguments in order to produce different shapes, and will be loaded with ```dotnet run <preset> <...args>```

- These algorithms should all be documented in the arguments they take, as well as give a help command that will show the user the arguments needed if they are entered incorrectly or if using ```dotnet run <preset> -h```
- All Presets should implement a common interface, such that they all conform to being passed varargs for their input and outputting a game map in return, returning a help string, returning an explanation of the preset

> Ex: ```dotnet run maze 10 10``` generates a 10x10 maze to explore
  
## A way to save maps in a temporary file location for autosaving and reloading, in case the user's program is terminated during a session for any reason

File writing may be a little iffy, but since the program is localized in one space, I should be able to write to a "saves" directory of some sort.

## An explanation of raycasting itself packaged in the program that can be visualized throughout the source code, as well as links to other resources for further research

All in all, this is really a project for learning, and I hope that if anyone does use it, others can learn from it and get inspired for their own iterations like I was by others
